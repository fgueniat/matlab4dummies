\section{What is the use of \matlab ?}
\matlab~(for MATrix LABoratory) aims at delivering quickly some \emph{relatively} inexpensive computations.
It shines, as expected from the name, when it involves linear algebra, i.e., operations on matrices.

The main advantage of \matlab compared to language like C/C++ or Fortran are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item No compilation
	\item The prompt
	\item Simplicity
	\item portability
	\item Built-in functions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item integration
			\item visualization
			\item tool-box
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The negative points are mostly:
\begin{itemize}
	\item sub performance
	\item not open source
	\item {\color{red} price}
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Equivalent of \matlab }

Octave and SciLab are almost identical to \matlab. A \matlab script would work on these two others open-source and free softwares.

Most of the tips can also be applied to python, especially when the packages scipy and numpy (for scientific and engineering computations) are used.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Philosophical idea of these teachings}
The objective of these tutorial are to illustrate the ENG 4XXX courses as well at to help you to learn quickly how to numerically solve problems.
It will hence give you the first concepts behind \matlab, coding and problem solving.
The emphasis here is “learning by doing”. Therefore, try not to read these documents without a computer close-by.

\subsection{\matlab as a software}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Start \matlab}
Click on the icon, duh!
%%!!!!!!!!!!!!111
\subsubsection{Organization of the window}

You can find a few important sections:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the command windows \\
		\comments{This is the prompt}
	\item current folder \\
		\comments{It lists the files}
	\item the Workspace \\
		\comments{It gives details on the objects present in memory}
	\item the editor \\
		\comments{this is where you can write a script}
	\item the ribbon \\
		\comments{It gives access to properties, functions, etc. Similar in spirit to Words and Excel.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to print "hello world"}

Click on the Command Window, and type "hello world".
You will see:

\begin{lstlisting}
>> 'Hello World'
ans =
Hello World
\end{lstlisting}

\medskip

\matlab~printed the 'Hello World', congratulations !

You can see also that the 'Hello World has been assignated to a variable named ans.

\defbox{ans}{Short for answer. The results of the command is always stored in the variable ans, if it is not assigned to an other variable. }


Now, try without the quotes, and you will see:
\begin{lstlisting}
>> Hello World
<@{\color{red}Undefined function or variable 'Hello'.}@>
\end{lstlisting}
plus some help.

Hello World is understood by \matlab as a function/variable and then an option for this function.
\matlab hence thinks that Hello is something that already exists, and it is not the case here. An error follow.

The main reason behind that is that we want to print a string.

\defbox{String}{Chain of character. It has to be between quotes: 'some text' or double quotes: "some text".}


Try now to add a semi colon at the end of the line:
\begin{lstlisting}
>> 'Hello World';
>>
\end{lstlisting}

Nothing is printed in the prompt.

\defbox{Prompt}{The $>>$ sign. Once enter is hit, \matlab will interpret the line}

One of the most important tip to remember: \matlab will always print the result of a line if it does not have a ";" at the end of the line.

\tipbox{
Do not forget  the ";" at the end of lines. 
}






\section{\matlab as a calculator}
\subsection{Algebra}

You can use \matlab as a calculator. 
Click on the prompt: 

\begin{lstlisting}
>> 4+3
ans =
7
>> 4*3
ans =
12
\end{lstlisting}

As expected, \matlab respects the BODMAS (Brackets, Order, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). 
Try a few operations !
\begin{lstlisting}
>> (4+3)*2
ans =
14
>> 4+3*2
ans =
10
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Variables}
ans can be used to store a result, but it will be overwritten every time a command is executed:

\begin{lstlisting}
>> 2+2
ans =
4
>> ans+2
ans =
6
>> ans+2
ans =
8
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Creation and re-assignement}

Variable can be easily created and assigned with the sign "=". 


\begin{lstlisting}
>> x = 2+2
x =
4
>> x+2
ans =
6
>> x*5
ans =
10
\end{lstlisting}

\defbox{variable}{a name that is associated with an value. Values can be results, functions or complex objects. They are usually assigned with the sign =}

%%!!!!!!!!!!!!111
\subsubsection{Naming convention}
A variable name can be anything, such as \mcode{goodnameforavariable} or  \mcode{GoodNameForAVariable}, or  \mcode{good\_name\_for\_a\_variable} .
However:
\begin{itemize}
	\item it cannot start with \_
	\item it cannot start with a number
	\item a few names are protected
\end{itemize}

\tipbox{Try to use clever name for variables, it will help to understand the code.  }

The choice of a name is important, for you a, \mcode{x} is good for an unknown, \mcode{s} if you expect its value to be a string, \mcode{v} if it is a vector... More complex names can be used, such as \mcode{x\_problem\_1}. Try to be consistent thorough the piece of code !

A few tips:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use different names for different results
	\item Use a name that is meaningfull (e.g. \mcode{str\_name} if the variable is assigned with a chain of character that is a name)
	\item Consequently, avoid unecessary use of index (e.g. \mcode{result\_1, result\_2} etc.)
\end{itemize}

\tipbox{You can use the following name convention: \mcode{UpperCamelCase} for functions, \mbox{\mcode{CAPITALIZED\_WITH\_UNDERSCORES}} for constants, and \mbox{\mcode{lowercase\_separated\_by\_underscores}} for other variables.}


%%!!!!!!!!!!!!111
\subsubsection{Reassignement}
Updating a variable is handy: you might want to change the variable \mcode{year} from \mcode{2017} to \mcode{2018}.

You can easily update a variable, by reassigning a new value to it. It hence uses the sign "=".
For instance:
\begin{lstlisting}
>> x = 2+2
x = 
4
>> x = x + 5
x =
9
>> x = 0
x =
0
\end{lstlisting}


%%!!!!!!!!!!!!111
\subsubsection{Exercices}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create the variables \mcode{x,y,z} assigned with $1$, $2$ and $3$.
	\item Create the variable \mcode{sum\_xyz} that is the sum of \mcode{x,y} and \mcode{z}.
	\item Propose a name for a variable that is assigned as a value \mcode{'Birmingham'}
	\item Propose a name for a variable that is assigned as a value \mcode{'BCU'}
	\item Try to assign to the variable \mcode{year} the value \mcode{2017}, and then to \mcode{2018}!
	\item Try to assign to the variable \mcode{girlfriend\_name} the value \mcode{'Adilah'} (using the sign equal, pun totally intended), and to the variable \mcode{ex\_girlfriend\_name} the value \mcode{'Marie'}.
Then, reassign to the variable \mcode{girlfriend\_name} the value \mcode{'Kiara'}, and to the variable \mcode{ex\_girlfriend\_name} the value \mcode{'Adilah'}.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Workspace}
When you have created a variable, it is available in the \emph{workspace}.
It is the area (usually) on the right.
It allows to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item show what variables are currently known to \matlab
	\item know what is present in the memory
	\item indicate what there is in the variables
	\item eventually modify the content of a variable
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Entering multiple commands per line}
It is possible to enter multiple commands per line. 
Use commas "," or semicolons ";" for that ; the commas will \emph{not} suppress the outputs.

\tipbox{Try to avoid multiple commands per line, most of the time, it makes the code harder to read.}

\begin{lstlisting}
>> x = 2 ; y = 3 ; z = 4 ;
>> x = 2 ; y = 3 , z = 4 ;
y = 
3
>> x = 2 , y = 3 , z = 4 ,
x = 
2
y = 
3
z = 
5
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection{Basic arithmetic}


Basic arithmetic operators are pretty classic:

\begin{table}[h!]\caption{Arithmetic operators}
\center
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
	\hline
	operation & command & exemple \\
	\hline
	addition & + & 3+4 \\
	soustraction & - & 3-4 \\
 	multiplication & * & 3*4 \\
	division & / & 3/4 \\
	power & \^{} & 2 \^{} 4 \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{How to find a function or a command ?}

If you look for something, hit the help button.
For instance, if you want to look for the sine function:

\todoimage{help sine}


\tipbox{Use the help! It is \emph{very} useful and you will mostly find any function/tool/infos that you need.}

%%!!!!!!!!!!!!111
\subsubsection{Using a function}
Calling a function is relatively easy and intuitive. Let's take the sine function as an illustration. 

\begin{lstlisting}
>> sin(3.14)
ans =
0.0016
\end{lstlisting}

You ask \matlab to evaluate the function \mcode{sin} in $3.14\approx \pi$. 
For that, you just put the argument in parenthesis.

\tipbox{Trigonometric functions in \matlab are in radiant!}

Typical functions are available with an explicit name,see Tab.~\ref{tab-func}. Similarly, many constants are implemented in \matlab.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\caption{A few function names in \matlab. Many others are already implemented in \matlab.}
	\label{tab-func}
\center
\begin{tabular}{|l|c||l|c||l|c|}
	\hline
	Trigonometry & name & Stats & name & Misc. & name\\
	\hline
	sine & sin  &
		mean & mean &
			square root & sqrt \\
			
	cosine & cos &
		maximum & max &
			absolute value & abs \\

	exponential & exp &
		minimum & min &
			round up & ceil \\		

		
	natural logarithm & log &
		standard dev. & std &
			conjugate & conj \\
	
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h!]
	\caption{A few useful constant names in \matlab.}

	$\pi$ & pi \\

\chapter{Linear Algebra}

Linear algebra is the fundations of \matlab, and what makes it popular.

In particular, \matlab makes the manipulation of matrices and vectors very easy.
This section will show how to do:
\begin{itemize}
	\item operations involving arrays, or vectors
	\item operations involving matrices
	\item operations involving both arrays and matrices
\end{itemize}


\section{Vectors}
\subsection{Creation of a vector}
\subsubsection{Line vector}
Creating a vector \mcode{v} is easy. You just put all the components between brackets.
\begin{lstlisting}
>> v = [1 2 3]
v =
1 2 3
\end{lstlisting}

Let's create Cartesian vectors in dimension two. $e_x = (1,0)$ and $e_y = (0,1)$:


\begin{lstlisting}
>> ex = [1 0]
ex =
1 0
>> ey = [0,1]
ey =
0 1
\end{lstlisting}
 
\tipbox{When creating a line vector, commas between components are unnecessary, but will help reading the code !}

\subsubsection{Column vector}
Creating a column vector is similar to creating a line vector, except that the element are separated with a semi-colon ";".


\begin{lstlisting}
>> v = [1;0;4]
v =
1
0
4
>> w = [0;1]
w =
0
1
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Transpose operator}
It is possible to change a column vector to a line vector, and reciprocaly, by using the transpose operator "'".
\begin{lstlisting}
>> ex = [1;0]
ex =
1
0
>> ex'
ans =
1 0
>> ey = [0,1]
ey =
0 1
>> ey'
ans =
0
1
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Access to the elements of a vector}

\subsubsection{Access to one element}

The first element of a vector \mcode{v} is \mcode{v(1)}.
The second element is \mcode{v(2)}, and so forth.

Accessing the element of a vector is just calling the vector with specifying the desired element:

\begin{lstlisting}
>> x = [1 3 4 -2.5 8]
x = 
1 3 4 -2.5 8
>> x(1)
ans = 
1
>> x(3)
ans = 
4
>> x(4)
ans = 
-2.5
\end{lstlisting}




The last element of a vector can be called using the argument \mcode{end}:
You can also call the ith item from the end using \mcode{end-i}. 
\begin{lstlisting}
>> x = [1 3 4 -2.5 8]
x = 
1.000 3.000 4.000 -2.5 8.000
>> x(end)
ans = 
8
>> x(end-1)
ans = 
-2.5
>> x(end-2)
ans = 
4
\end{lstlisting}



\subsubsection{Access to several elements}

The operator ":" gives access to all the elements between the first and the last element (included), in a column vector:

\begin{lstlisting}
>> v = [1 3 4 -2.5 8];
>> v(:)
ans = 
1
3
4
-2.5
8
\end{lstlisting}

Accessing to all the elements between the second and fifth element of \mcode{v} is \mcode{v(2:5)}:

\begin{lstlisting}
>> v = [1 3 4 -2.5 8 12];
>> v(2:5)
ans = 
3
4
-2.5
8
\end{lstlisting}
To access to \emph{all} the elements between the first and the last element (included), in a column vector, simply use the colon operator:

\begin{lstlisting}
>> x = [1 3 4 -2.5 8];
>> x(:)
ans = 
1
3
4
-2.5
8
\end{lstlisting}



\tipbox{The colon operator is useful to generate lists and extract sub-parts of vectors/matrices.}

\subsection{Basic operations on vectors}
\subsubsection{Addition/subtraction}
It is easy to add or subtract a given value to \emph{all} the components of a vector, using the signs "+" and "-".

\begin{lstlisting}
>> x = [1 3]
x = 
1 3
>> x + 4
ans =
5 7
>> y = x - 2
y =
-1 1
>> z = [5 10 -1 8] + 3
z = 
8 13 2 11
\end{lstlisting}


Vectors can be added, as long as their dimensions correspond:

\begin{lstlisting}
>> ex = [1 0]; ey = [0,1] ;
>> ex + ey
ans =
1 1
>> ex - ey
ans =
1 -1
\end{lstlisting}

Of course, if their dimensions do not correspond, \matlab will send back and error:

\begin{lstlisting}
>> x =[1,0] ; y = [1,0,0];
>> x+y
<@{\color{red}Matrix dimensions must agree.}@>
\end{lstlisting}




\tipbox{\matlab considers vectors as 1D matrices.}



\subsubsection{Multiplication}
It is easy to multiply or divide by a given value to \emph{all} the components of a vector, using the signs "*" and "/"

\begin{lstlisting}
>> x = [1 3]
x = 
1 3
>> x * 4
ans =
4 12
>> y = x / 2.
y =
0.5 1.5
>> z = 3 * [5 10 -1 8]
z = 
15 30 -3 24
\end{lstlisting}

What is multiplication for vectors ?

Two definitions can be proposed.

\paragraph{dot product}
The first definition is the dot product between two vectors.
\defbox{dot product}{The dot product (or inner product) of two vectors is the sum of the multiplication of their components. If $u=(u_i),v=(v_i)$ are $n$-dimensional vectors, $<u,v>= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n u_i \times v_i $.}


It can be done using the function \mcode{dot}.
\begin{lstlisting}
>> x =[1,0] ; y = [1,0];
>> dot(x,y)
ans = 
1
>> x(1) * y(1) + x(2) * y(2)
ans =
1
>> a =[0,0.5,2] ; b = [2,0,4];
>> dot(a,b)
ans = 
8
>> a(1) * b(1) + a(2) * b(2) + a(3) * b(3)    
and =
8
\end{lstlisting}


\paragraph{Element-wise multiplication}
Another definition could be the element wise multiplication.
It means that each element of a vector is multiply by the corresponding element of the other vector.
It is similar to the dot product \emph{except} for the sum.
The operator for that is ".*" (it is read "dot product", which is pretty stupid when you think about it!).

\begin{lstlisting}
>> x =[1,0] ; y = [1,0];
>> x.*y
ans = 
1 0
>> [x(1) * y(1), x(2) * y(2)]
ans =
1 0
>> a =[0,0.5,2] ; b = [2,0,4];
>> a.*b
ans = 
0 0 8
>> [a(1) * b(1), a(2) * b(2), a(3) * b(3)]
and =
0 0 8
\end{lstlisting}


\tipbox{In \matlab, using "." in front of an operator means that this operator will be applied element-wise (to each element of the vector/matrix).}


\todo{exercices}

\section{Matrices}
\matlab sees vectors a line matrices. Building a matrix is the equivalent of stacking lines.
For that, \matlab uses the semi colon sign ";".
The following lines are equivalent:
\begin{lstlisting}
>> M =[1,0 ; 0,1];
M = 
1 0
0 1
>> m =[1,0 ; 0 1];
M = 
1 0
0 1
>> m =[ [1,0] ; [0 1]];
M = 
1 0
0 1
\end{lstlisting}

The last line shows that a matrix is virtually stacked vectors.



\todo{exercices}
Try to create the vector $x = (1,2,3,4)$.

\section{What to remember}
\subsection{Creating a matrix}
Follow the procedure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item start with a bracket [
	\item write each element of a column, separated with space or commas
	\item separate rows with a semi-colon
	\item end with the bracket ]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Manipulating matrices}
You can
\begin{itemize}
	\item add, subtract, multiply matrices if their sizes are compatible
	\item access to the ith element of matrix \mcode{M} using \mcode{M(i)}
	\item access to the (ith,jth) element of matrix \mcode{M} using \mcode{M(i,j)}
\end{itemize}
